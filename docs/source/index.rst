Welcome to LFSBuilder's documentation!
======================================

**LFSBuilder** is a Python program that allows you to automatically build a `Linux from Scratch system <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/>`_. It can also be used with the `Beyond Linux from Scratch <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/>`_ book or your own components.

This tool is designed under the `Object Oriented Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`_ paradigm to simplify the code structure and also implements an extra customizable layer on top of the core functionality of the tool. This extra layer allows users to build an operating system that fits the requirements of multiple use cases.
