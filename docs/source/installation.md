# Installation

To use LFSBuilder you only need to download its source code from [Github](https://github.com/gongomgra/lfsbuilder) and install its dependencies using the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager.

To do so, run the command below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: alternatively, you can install those dependencies into a virtualenv.
