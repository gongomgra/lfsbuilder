# 'curl' xml files run commands using logical conditions.
# That is: patch && configure && make
# We are applying patches in a previous step, so 'configure' never
# run because the 'patch' commands return 'FALSE' and the conditional statement
# ends in that point: patch && configure && make --> 0 && configure && make
# We enforce to return 'TRUE' to workaround it
