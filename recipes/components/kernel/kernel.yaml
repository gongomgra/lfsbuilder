# We use the 'configure' step, which is empty on the book, to ensure that
# provided config file is valid for the kernel version we are trying to build
# before actually building it with 'make', by running the 'make olddefconfig' command.
#
# By doing this, we ensure that the 'make oldconfig' command, which run an interactive session,
# won't be run and that all the required options for the new kernel version are set
# with its default values.
